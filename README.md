# Dynamic Trees for Heat and Climate
Dynamic Trees compatibility add-on for Heat and Climate currently in the works. This is a fork of [odorousrex's](https://github.com/odorousrex) [original project](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-trees-heat-and-climate-compat), as it no longer works with newer versions of Dynamic Trees.

## Supported Trees
- Lemon
- Morus
- Olive
